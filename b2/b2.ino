/*
  Anything Written between the /*(forward-slash asterisk) and (asterisk forward slash) characters are treated as 
  multiline comments. These parts of the program are not compiled or sent to the microcontroller. Its is good 
  practice to comment your code so that anyone else that reads it can understand what is going on.  
  This includes you! If you return to your code after time away its easy to forget things so comments can really 
  help!

 // Text proceeding a doublefoward slash is treated as a comment and is used for single line comments! 

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
void setup() {                
// put your setup code here!     
}

// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
void loop() {
 // put your main code here! 
}
